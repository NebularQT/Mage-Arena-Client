**This is a Mod Menu / Client for the Game Mage Arena**

Please **do not use this in public lobbies** if somehow you see this
the Controls will show up on the GUI of the Menu.
you need to Install BepinEx 5, extract into your games local folder, 
run the game one time, then you should see a BepinEx\Plugins\
and put the dll in there then start your game and press
";" to toggle the menu.

Warning! you can toggle/activate things OUTSIDE of games, i suggest toggling
the meun off if you are going to type in the chat at all before starting

also i apologise for the bad keybinds, if you want to customise them 
just clone the repo and change them in InputHandler, NoClip and InfiniteHealh

---------------------------
this includes:

Esp,
Movement Modifications,
Instant Smiting,
Instant Spells,
Custom Spells,
Infinite stats,
No Clip,
Size/Scale changer,
Instant win (client side),
and more.
